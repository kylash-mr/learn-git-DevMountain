# Git Odyssey: Chapter 3 - The Collaboration Treaty

## Introduction
This chapter simulates collaboration using forks and pull requests. By forking the repository, I worked on a separate branch and pushed changes via a pull request.

## Collaboration Workflow:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone it locally.
3. Create a branch for updates.
4. Push changes and open a Pull Request.

## Commands Used:
- `git fork`
- `git clone`
- `git branch`
- `git push`
